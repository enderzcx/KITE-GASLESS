Just shipped **KITE GASLESS v1.3.0** on KiteAI Testnet.

What’s new:
- Added **Abuse / Over-limit graceful-failure** demo cases
- Added policy evidence logs for rejected actions
- Synced Agent Settings limits directly to backend x402 policy gateway

Now each paid action has both:
1) x402 payment mapping (`402 -> pay -> proof -> 200`)
2) explicit scope/limit enforcement evidence in UI/logs

This makes the demo much closer to real agent payment safety:
policy gate at API layer + on-chain execution guarantees.
